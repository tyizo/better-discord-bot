a nice discord bot with a lot of useful commands and advanced command handler.

how to run this ?

first of all, go to config.json and full these blanks:
```
{
  "token": "bot token here",
  "prefix": "command prefix here"
  "status": "your bot status"
}
```

after that:
```
1 - git clone https://github.com/tyizo/better-discord-bot/
2 - npm i
3 - node .
```
